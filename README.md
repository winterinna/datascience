<h1>Police Shootings in USA</h1>

<p>There have been numerous discussions recently about deaths in America caused by police operations. For this reason, I became interested in this topic.
In the real discussions it was about the fact that the colored inhabitants of the USA are often subject to the identity check and are often treated unfairly by the police, sometimes fatal, which happens more often than people with white skin.So I decided to check which image I get from the file according to the numbers.</p>

The FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete The number of fatal shootings increases every year, so that the FBI has started to pursue the topic.

At first step I wanted to to see what it looks like in case of race and age. I also wanted to answer the question, what do the numbers look like in relation to gender and which type of weapon was most preferred. The numbers were shown in relation to states and cities.

<p>After my inquiries in the direction outlined above, I found out the following: three groups of people died most frequently during police operations.</p> 
<p>These are</p> 
<ol>
  <li>W: white, </li>
  <li>B: black, followed by </li>
  <li>H: Hispanic. </li>
</ol>  
 
<p>The group of the male population has higher numbers for getting shot or shot and tasered. The most prefered weapons, whether men or women, are guns and knives. Unfortunately, people were also shot when they did not have any weapons at all in hand.</p>
